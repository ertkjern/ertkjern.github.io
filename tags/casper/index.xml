      <title>My first blog post!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided to try this thing known as blogging. Not because I feel the need to share what I do with anyone, but mostly for learning.
When I look at new programming languages, tools&amp;rsquo;, frameworks or anything, I will sometimes write a small blog post, right here, or maybe a tiny tutorial.
By doing this I can always come back to the blog and use it as a reference, or maybe someone else might learn or find any of my blog posts interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you have probably figured out, this blog post will mostly contain tech related topics. And since this blog post is built on a static web page generator known as Hugo,
the next post will be about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will enjoy my writings, if not, I will enjoy it myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;
