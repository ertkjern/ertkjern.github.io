      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided to try doing some blogging. Not because I feel the need to share what I do with someone, but mostly for my own learning. The blog will therefore mainly contain
tech related posts. Me trying and figuring out different programming languages, tools or anything tech releated and sharing my opinion. Mainly for self learning, but also for others to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either if I am writing this only for me, or if there acctualy are any readers of this blog: I hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating this blog I was using a static web page generator known as Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
